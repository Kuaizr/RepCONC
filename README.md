# RepCONC

This is the official repo for our WSDM'22 paper, [Learning Discrete Representations via Constrained Clustering for Effective and Efficient Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05789.pdf). The codes and models will be available soon (before the end of Oct).

For now, we refer you to [JPQ](https://github.com/jingtaozhan/JPQ), the prior work of RepCONC. JPQ is adopted by RepCONC for second-stage training.
